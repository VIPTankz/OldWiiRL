This is a very old version of the code seen on my YouTube channel, and does not represent what is currently being done in any way. You can attempt to use this code if you like, but do so at your own risk since there is minimal documentation, and this is definitely not the best way to do things. 

I may release the source code for the actual version at some point, but I do not yet know when that'll be.
